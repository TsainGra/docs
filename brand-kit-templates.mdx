You can set up various **Brand Kits & Templates** with your brand color, fonts, logos, and more to make your clips on-brand and more recognizable.

To set up your brand template, click **Brand Kit** on the left side panel.

## Make your first brand template

To setup your brand template, open up the editor with any video file you have already uploaded on the software. Use the 'Edit' button to do this, and your clip will open in the editor.

  style={{ width:"85%" }}
/>

Now, feel free to make changes to the clip itself on the editor screen. You can easily change the captions styles, fonts, size, background, add your logo and pretty much customize everything on the editor.

  title="Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 16.27.42.png"
  style={{ width:"95%" }}
/>

Once you're happy with how the clip looks, you can click on the button on the top right that says "Save Template" and give your template a name, and select "Save as new template".

  style={{ width:"88%" }}
/>

Your first brand template is now ready\!

<Tip>
  If you're planning to get clips in multiple aspect ratios (ie, portrait, landscape, etc), it's a great idea to create and save a brand template for each of those aspect ratios.
</Tip>

## Set Brand Template as Default

You can set your brand template as the default template, so that it is applied to all videos and clips that are made in the future. 

To do this, head to the home page and click on the profile icon on the top right. Click on "Settings".
