You can create custom clips using either timestamps or the transcript of the video itself.

<Tip>
  Using custom clips is a great option when you have a segment in mind that the AI did not clip or you want to render the entire video.
</Tip>

To create a custom clip using transcript, click on the custom clip button on the screen with all your clips and then select "Create from Transcript".

  title="Screenshot 2025-07-02 at 09.58.30.png"
  style={{ width:"72%" }}
  className="mr-auto"
/>

You will now see the transcript of the whole video on the screen, on which you can drag and select the section you want to clip as shown below.

Once you're satisfied with the selection, click on the "Preview and Create" button.
