Instagram authenticates through Facebook, so when you click the Instagram icon on the Social Accounts page, a Facebook sign-in will pop up - _please be sure you allow pop-ups_.

## Enabling an Instagram Business or Creator Account

Instagram requires that your account be an **Instagram Business** or **Instagram Creator** account linked to a **Facebook Page**, but don’t worry, it is free and easy to set up.

If you don’t have a Facebook Page, you can set up one.

<Tip>
  Your Instagram account is required to be a **Business or Creator Profile** and connected to your Facebook Page. This is required by Instagram for posting images and videos.

  If you already have a Facebook Page, continue on. Otherwise, **create a new Facebook Page** by logging into Facebook and going to the [**Facebook Page Creation**](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/?ref_type=site_footer).
</Tip>

### **Switching from a Personal to a Business or Creator Account**

If you have a personal Instagram account, open up the Instagram mobile app:

- Go to your profile and tap the menu icon ≡ in the upper right corner to go to the **Settings and Activity** page.
- Scroll down to the **For Professionals** section.
- Click **Account type and Tools**.
- Tap **Switch to a professional account**.
- Go through the steps to set up your account and select with **Creator** or **Business**.
- You may be asked to select a **Facebook Page** to connect.

If you already have an Instagram Business/Creator account, you can **connect your Facebook Page to Instagram** by going to the _Facebook Page you manage -\> Page Settings -\> Instagram_. If it isn’t connected, you can click the “Connect” button on that page.[**​**](https://www.ayrshare.com/docs/dashboard/connect-social-accounts/instagram#switching-from-a-business-to-creator-or-vice-versa)
