You can create custom clips using either timestamps or the transcript of the video itself.

<Tip>
  Using custom clips is a great option when you have a segment in mind that the AI did not clip or you want to render the entire video.
</Tip>

To create a custom clip using timestamps, click on the custom clip button on the screen with all your clips and then select "Create from Timestamp".

<img

  alt="Screenshot 2025-07-02 at 10.09.08.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-07-02 at 10.09.08.png"
  style={{ width:"71%" }}
/>

You will now see options to select start & end time of the clip, along with an option to give it a name. Drag the corners to select the times and keep an eye on the length of the video. 

Click on "Create" when you are happy with the clip.
