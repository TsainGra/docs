We support videos upto 5 hours in length. Longer videos may not upload or process correctly. \
To ensure you get clips or captions perfectly, follow these guidelines.

- Make sure your video has spoken words
- All aspect ratios are supported
- Videos without any spoken word will likely not process

<Warning>
  iPhone HDR videos will typically wash out or fade in colour. This is due to the settings on the iPhone itself. If you're recording videos on your iPhone, make sure to turn this setting off.
