## Can I login with an email account?

Yes.

## What if I want to login through email verification instead of Google login?

We provide login options via both Google and email. If you created your account using Google, you can add an email login method to it, using the same email address associated with your Google account.

Hereâ€™s how:

1. Log out of your account created with Google.
2. Log back in using the same email address associated with your Google account.
3. You will receive a verification code via email; use this code to log in.

Moving forward, your team members can log in to OpusClip directly using this email address and the verification code sent to it.
