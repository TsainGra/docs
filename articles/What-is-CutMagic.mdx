## How to enable CutMagic?

When uploading your videos 

You have to enable CutMagic while uploading your video; it is toggled on by default. If a video is processed without CutMagic enabled, it cannot be enabled retrospectively.

You can toggle CutMagic here:

<img
  src="/images/image.png"
  alt="image.png"
  title="image.png"
  style={{ width:"82%" }}
/>
