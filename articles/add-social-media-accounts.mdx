## Understanding Social Sets

We support linking of "sets" of social media accounts. All paid plans come with 1 set of accounts.

Each set of social account connections consists of Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter, Youtube, X/Twitter & Pinterest. You can purchase and setup multiple sets of social accounts.

The <u>Lite plan</u> offers only Tiktok account linking.\
<u>Essential</u> & <u>Growth plans</u> allow you to link all 7 social platforms listed below in sets.

<Info>
  Social sets are incredibly helpful when you want to connect social media accounts of multiple clients that you are working with.
