The number of clips you get on [quso.ai](http://quso.ai) depends on the length of your imported or uploaded video.

- 0-3 min: Typically no clips
- 3-10 min: 4-12 clips
- 10-30 min: 8-20 clips
- 30-60 min: 12-30 clips
- 60-120 min: 18-40 clips
- Over 120 min: 22-60 clips

You can also create custom clips, with timestamps or transcript manually, should you want to make a clip that the AI was unable to capture.
