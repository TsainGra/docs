You can invite team members who work with you to your workspace, and assign roles to them.

To invite a team member, click on the "Invite" button on your dashboard.

Alternatively, you can also navigate to the "Settings" by clicking on your profile icon, and then go to "Workspace & team details"

<Info>
  Team member seats are billed at an additional \$9 per month per seat, or \$90 per year per seat. If you're on an annual plan, your team member seat will also be added on an annual basis.

When you invite a team member, they will get an email asking them to join your workspace.

All paid plans allow you to add upto 4 team members. If you need more than 4 seats, please contact us.

  The main account or parent account is treated as the primary owner of any workspace. All other team members are added as members only and have restricted capabilites.
