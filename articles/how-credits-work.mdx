## What are credits?

Credits are used to process the video Projects. Processing clips will cost 1 credit for each minute of the uploaded project.

<Tip>
  For example, processing a 10-minute video will cost you 10 credits
</Tip>

If you're on an annual plan, you'll receive all your credits for the full 12 months upfront. If you're on a monthly plan, you'll receive your credits one month at a time.

## Calculation for credit usage

For processing videos, credits are calculated in whole minutes.

- Videos that are less than a minute are rounded up to the nearest minute. (Eg, a 40-second video is rounded up and will cost you 1 credit)
- Videos with partial minutes are also rounded up to the nearest minute. (Eg, a video that is 25 minutes and 40 seconds long it will cost you 26 credits)

## Do credits expire

Credits from your **base plan** expire at the end of each subscription period.

- If you're on a **monthly plan**, unused credits will **not roll over** to the next month.
- If you're on an **annual plan**, credits will reset at the end of the 12-month period.

However, this **does not apply to add-on credits** purchased separately. These **do not expire** and can be used at any time.

## How do I get more credits?

There are many different ways to get more credits:

- **Adding Credits**\
  You can add more credits to your plan anytime by clicking the **"Add Credits"** button located at the bottom left of the home page. Each credit costs **\$0.15**, though the price may vary based on your region.

- **Upgrading Your Plan**\
  Need more credits or additional features? You can upgrade to a higher-tier plan to receive more monthly credits along with access to all the benefits that come with that tier.
- **Switching to an Annual Plan**\
  Switching from a monthly to an annual plan gives you all 12 months’ worth of credits upfront—perfect for those who prefer to plan ahead or use more credits at once.

## How are credits consumed in my team workspace?

Only the **team owner** can purchase a paid plan for the team. Once the plan is active, **credits are shared** across all team members.
