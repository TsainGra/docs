## **Select Company or Personal LinkedIn Account**

You will be redirected back to Ayrshare where you can select the LinkedIn account type you wish to link with Ayrshare. You may either choose a LinkedIn company page or your personal LinkedIn account.

<Tip>
  If selecting to link a company page, the LinkedIn user must be a Super Admin or Content Admin of the company page to link it with Ayrshare.

## **LinkedIn Troubleshooting**

The most common error you may encounter is a company page not showing in the list of available companies. This can be caused by the LinkedIn user not being a Super Admin or Content Admin of the company page, and can be fixed by a Super Admin of the company page **updating the user’s page role**.
